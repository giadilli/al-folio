  title={The Ghost in the Machine has an American accent: value conflict in GPT-3},

  abstract={The alignment problem in the context of large language models must consider the plurality of human values in our world. Whilst there are many resonant and overlapping values amongst the world's cultures, there are also many conflicting, yet equally valid, values. It is important to observe which cultural values a model exhibits, particularly when there is a value conflict between input prompts and generated outputs. We discuss how the co-creation of language and cultural value impacts large language models (LLMs). We explore the constitution of the training data for GPT-3 and compare that to the world's language and internet access demographics, as well as to reported statistical profiles of dominant values in some Nation-states. We stress tested GPT-3 with a range of value-rich texts representing several languages and nations; including some with values orthogonal to dominant US public opinion as reported by the World Values Survey. We observed when values embedded in the input text were mutated in the generated outputs and noted when these conflicting values were more aligned with reported dominant US values. Our discussion of these results uses a moral value pluralism (MVP) lens to better understand these value mutations. Finally, we provide recommendations for how our work may contribute to other current work in the field.},

  title={What lies behind AGI: ethical concerns related to LLMs},
  author={G. Pistilli},
  abstract={This paper opens the philosophical debate around the notion of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its application in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through the lens of moral philosophy, the paper raises questions about these AI systems' capabilities and goals, the treatment of humans behind them, and the risk of perpetuating a monoculture through language.},

Par le bias d'une recherche sur le terrain, je cherche à montrer comment il existe deux différentes adoptions de la technologie de la part de l'administration publique : une complexifiante et une simplifiante.},

  title={Journal issue, vol. 2: Technology and Constructive Critical Thought},
  author={G. Pistilli and M. Puech},
  abstract={Does critical thinking have anything to say to technology?  Something constructive? We asked ourselves this question, based on our mixed experience of research in philosophy and work in business.  We tried to generate articles and start a conversation, through the association Filosofia in Movimento, on the theme "technology and constructive critical thinking". This issue collects the articles that came out of this process.  We suggested a list of themes: why are technophobic intellectuals dominant? How to build the societal acceptability of new technologies? Is the Internet a tool for critical thinking? Can artificial intelligences function as mediators of a critical conversation? What is the middle way between technophile utopia and technophobe dystopia? What does science fiction teach us as a "sandbox" for critical thinking about technology?  Should we politicize or depoliticize technology? Some of these questions have been answered directly, others indirectly, and some have not been answered at all, which could be significant as well.},
