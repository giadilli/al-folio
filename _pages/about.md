I am a researcher in philosophy, specializing in ethics applied to conversational AI systems. My research is mainly focused on comparative ethical frameworks, value pluralism, and Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models).

After obtaining a master's degree in ethics and political philosophy at [Sorbonne Université](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr) in 2019, I continued my doctoral research in the same faculty, joining the Sorbonne Université - CNRS mixed unit laboratory [Sciences, Normes, Democratie](https://snd.sorbonne-universite.fr/). 

I am currently an ethicist at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) where I do philosophical and interdisciplinary research on AI Ethics.
