I am a researcher in philosophy, specializing in ethics applied to Conversational Artificial Intelligence. My research mainly focuses on comparative ethical frameworks, value theory, and ethics applied to Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models).

After obtaining a master's degree in ethics and political philosophy at [Sorbonne Université](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr) in 2019, I pursued my doctoral research in the same faculty, joining the Sorbonne Université - CNRS mixed unit laboratory [Sciences, Normes, Democratie](https://snd.sorbonne-universite.fr/giada-pistilli/). 

I am currently Principal Ethicist at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), where I do philosophical and interdisciplinary research on AI Ethics.
