I am a researcher in philosophy, specializing in ethics applied to Conversational Artificial Intelligence. My research mainly focuses on comparative ethical frameworks, value theory, and ethics applied to Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models). My work in the field has led me to be selected in the 2024 list of "[100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics](https://womeninaiethics.org/directory/index.php)", promoted by [Women in AI Ethics](https://womeninaiethics.org/).

After obtaining a master's degree in ethics and political philosophy at [Sorbonne Université](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr) in 2019, I pursued my doctoral research in the same faculty, joining the Sorbonne Université - CNRS mixed unit laboratory "[Sciences, Normes, Democratie](https://snd.sorbonne-universite.fr/giada-pistilli/)". 

I am currently Principal Ethicist at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), doing philosophical and interdisciplinary research on AI Ethics. Read more about my typical workday in my [Business Insider profile](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-ai-ethicist-working-to-make-the-tech-safe-2023-5).

Additionally, my academic and professional experiences include policy and international relations, notably highlighted by a role at the European Parliament in Brussels, where I focused on human rights.
