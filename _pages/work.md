After over two years and a half as a research engineer working on chatbots for the public sector, since May 2022 I am a full-time **ethicist** at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

I am bringing my research background in **philosophy** to do interdisciplinary and empirical research in ethics applied to Machine Learning. 

Check out this page which I will update regularly as soon as I take over the projects!
