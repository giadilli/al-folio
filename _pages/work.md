Since October 2019, I have integrated the technical team of the Parisian start-up [Les petits bots](https://lespetitsbots.com/) as a **research engineer** (R&D). The company develops **conversational agents** targeting the French public administration. There are two main SaaS products: one chatbot for human resources and a second one for local governments. My research focuses primarily on the latter. I raise the main research questions: how to make a chatbot acceptable to its population? How to deliver the right public service based on the specific problems of citizens? How can we ensure that citizens trust the AI system to chat with it? How to organize the knowledge of public organizations within a knowledge base? How to guarantee a good degree of confidentiality of the data contained in the conversations? How to adapt the chatbot to the language of the impacted population?

From an **ethical point of view**, I advise the conversational agents' technical and product design, development, deployment, and monitoring daily. In particular, I explore the ethical issues in the use of conversational artificial intelligence in the public sector. The results of my R&D become, for example, reports for product research, user research (UX/UI), ethical frameworks, and workshops in ethics to raise awareness on all of these issues within the work team. The approach I use is primarily user-focused, and I work alongside the company's engineers and UX/UI designers.

Another background research I've conducted has been to get the company to adopt an [ethical charter](https://lespetitsbots.com/charte-ethique). The objective of this charter is to set the ethical principles that commit Les petits bots to the technological choices of its products and its modes of action. The mission is to structure its technological development practices around **ethical principles** to express tomorrow's design. Furthermore, the company wishes to share these ethical principles publicly so that everyone can follow them and join in. Finally, to make it a practical matter, the company shares in a transparent way its action plans and technology roadmaps aimed at implementing these ethical principles in its products and services.
