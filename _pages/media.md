My work and research have been featured in internationally renowned media, such as [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00423-4), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/18/chatgpt-personal-use/), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/12/1055817/inside-a-radical-new-project-to-democratize-ai/), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/lamda-sentient-ai-bias-google-blake-lemoine/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-03/chatgpt-bing-and-bard-don-t-hallucinate-they-fabricate), and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-ai-ethicist-working-to-make-the-tech-safe-2023-5?r=US&IR=T), as well as in [Le Figaro](https://www.lefigaro.fr/livres/chatgpt-est-il-ecrivain-20230312), [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/is-centralised-ai-unethical/), and [La Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2023/02/19/news/fare_il_jailbreak_di_una_ia_cosi_chatgpt_ci_ha_spiegato_come_vendere_droga_a_scuola-387353948/). 

I also wrote an op-ed on [debating whether AI is conscious is a distraction from real problems](https://techpolicy.press/debating-whether-ai-is-conscious-is-a-distraction-from-real-problems/), and discussed the pitfalls of fear-mongering in AI in my [Analytics India Magazine profile](https://analyticsindiamag.com/the-pitfalls-of-fear-mongering-in-ai/). 

With a strong inclination towards science outreach and informing the general public, engagement with journalists is always welcomed. Should you be in the field of journalism and interested in discussing my work and research further, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
