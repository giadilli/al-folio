I am a researcher in philosophy, specializing in ethics applied to conversational AI systems. My research is mainly focused on comparative ethical frameworks, value pluralism, and Natural Language Processing.

After obtaining a master's degree in ethics and political philosophy at [Sorbonne Université](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr) in 2019, I continued my doctoral research in the same faculty, joining the Sorbonne Université - CNRS mixed unit laboratory [Sciences, Normes, Democratie](https://snd.sorbonne-universite.fr/). 

I am also a research engineer at [Les petits bots](https://lespetitsbots.com) where I am conducting my empirical research on conversational agents for the public sector. There, I coordinate an R&D team of designers and software developers on the design, development, and deployment phases of conversational agents for French local governments and their inhabitants. I also proudly led the reflections, drafting and action plans of the company's [ethical charter](https://lespetitsbots.com/charte-ethique).
